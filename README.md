This program generates a violin plot after taking a csv file as input. I have not made this program runnable through command line arguments.
For generating the violin plot, I would suggest you to "git clone" my code and make necessary changes in position highlighted in the code.

A sample output is provided for intuition.

The program will perform MinMax Scaling on your data so that class imbalance can be sorted out.

You can even provide you own colors. See this http://matplotlib.org/api/colors_api.html for color codes.

Happy Coding !!
